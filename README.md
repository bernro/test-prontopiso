# ProntoPiso test

We do a little test with React, Redux and Axios, to generate the basic structure, and do a call test to our staging api.


## Run the app

0. ```npm install```
0. ```npm start```

Once running, if you want to hide the redux dev monitor: ```CTRL+H```

## Build the app
```npm run build```

This will build the app into the "dist" directory in the root of the project. It contains the index.html along with the minified assets, ready for production.
